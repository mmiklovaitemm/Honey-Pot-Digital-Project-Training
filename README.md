ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to Honey Pot Digital Project ðŸŽ‰

Hi there!
As a total beginner in website development, I'm still getting the hang of things. 
I'm basically taking inspiration from existing websites and trying my hand at coding by recreating their designs from scratch.
This site isn't exactly my brainchild; I'm more like a student, learning as I go and practicing by replicating what I see. 
But hey, we all have to start somewhere, right?
Feel free to take a look around and see what I've come up with. 
And if you have any thoughts, suggestions, or just want to chat, hit me up! 
You can drop me a message on GitHub or connect with me on social media.
Happy coding,
UgnÄ—
