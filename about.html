                <p class="about-me-p1">Hi, I'm Emma<br>Peacock!</p>
                <p class="about-me-p2 only-one-p2">DIGITAL MARKETING STRATEGIST</p>
                <p class="about-me-p2">I'm a New Zealand born gal, with an<br>excitement for helping my client's find<br>their
                     authentic approach to marketing<br>their own business.
                </p>
                <p class="about-me-p3">My experience is a mix of in-house and<br>external, ecommerce and service<br>businesses,
                     across digital and traditional<br>marketing. I don't play favourites...
                </p>
                <p class="about-me-p4">The best part of my work day is seeing a<br>business owner relax, 
                    as they release the<br>imaginary and unnecessary weight off<br>their shoulders.
                </p>
                <p class="about-me-p4">On the weekends I'm an avid house plant<br>propagator, bad ceramicist, sweet treats<br>eater,
                     and can fit a movie quote into<br>almost any conversation for my own<br>enjoyment.

            <p class="my-focus-p1">My Focus</p>

            <p class="my-focus-p2">Sustainable Marketing</p>
            <p class="my-focus-p3">Your marketing should always be profitable, and manageable. You need the time to regularly create,<br> 
                manage all the inquiries and sales coming in, and continue to serve your existing clients and<br>customers. I work with my 
                clients to get them un-stuck, inspired, and excited to create new<br>marketing experiences.
            </p>
            <p class="my-focus-p4">Where possible, we also lower our impact on the earth by avoiding wasteful practices, because they<br>are 
                also wasteful of your energy. Most of what benefits the user experience with faster page<br>speeds and better SEO, also 
                reduces carbon production, so it's a win-win.</p>


            <p class="my-focus-p2">Holistic Marketing</p>
            <p class="my-focus-p3">I prefer to focus on marketing any business by combining all the marketing components together,<br> 
                including digital, traditional and in person marketing. I work with my clients to link these connections<br>
                to create a premium experience for their potential customers.
            </p>
            <p class="my-focus-p4">By creating one unified message, we can have fun with the delivery, and craft the experience to the<br>
                setting it takes place in.
            </p>

            <p class="my-focus-p2">Data-Driven Marketing</p>
            <p class="my-focus-p3">Marketing online allows for great analytics and reporting. We break down this data together to<br> 
                determine the success of your efforts, so you and I can better understand the otherwise<br>subjective details, and 
                let the target audience be the decider of what's working. These numbers give<br>you the confidence to decide what's working,
                 and drop what isn't.
            <p class="my-focus-p4">I help my clients understand what's measurable and what isn’t. We know that what is easily measured<br>
                is not always the right thing to indicate the success or failure of a marketing initiative, so I work<br>with my clients 
                to explore the possibilities.</p>
